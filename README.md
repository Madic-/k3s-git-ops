## ðŸŒŽ Overview

This repository is a playground for my Kubernetes Home Cluster.

It uses [ArgoCD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) as a GitOPs platform to automate the deployment and keep the cluster in a consistent state.

For more information take a lookt at my [docs](https://madic-.github.io/k3s-git-ops/).
